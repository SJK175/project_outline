organization - Abzooba Inc.
Worked as a back-end developer in a web based solution development project with one of the largest US based health care organization. The project was aimed towards 
providing a solution to our client's medical team to specify health goals (a.k.a interventions) for each of their patients. We also incorporated a statistical model to 
predict the probability of successful completion of "medical goals" based on patient's demographic & medical attributes.
